### Description
Have you ever wanted to place fences...\
... close to map objects,\
... close to placeables or other objects,\
... close to other fences,\
... somewhere the game just does not allow you to?

This mod disables many restrictions on fence-placing and gives you more freedom designing your dream farm.

Error messages such as "Area is restricted" and "Collides with another item" will be disabled by this mod. All the fence constructions in the screenshots would not be possible in any way without this mod.

You are still required to have access to the farmland you want to place the fence on. This way, you can safely use this mod in a multiplayer game!
